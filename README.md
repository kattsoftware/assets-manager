## Introduction

Phassets is a PHP library for managing Web assets, making it easy, simple and effective. 

Minifying the JS/CSS? Compiling the SCSS to CSS? Deploying these to local filesystem or a cloud provider, such as Amazon S3? Just some things that this library is doing.

The base (and required) component, `kattsoftware/phassets`, can be installed via [composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```
composer require kattsoftware/phassets:0.2.0-beta
```
